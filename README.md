# Data Structures
Data Structure is a way of collecting and organising data in such a way that we can perform 
operations on these data in an effective way. 

In simple language, Data Structures are structures programmed to store ordered data,
so that various operations can be performed on it easily. It represents the knowledge
of data to be organized in memory. It should be designed and implemented in such a way
that it reduces the complexity and increases the efficiency.

## Basic types of Data Structures
- Linked List
- Tree
- Graph
- Stack, Queue etc.

# Algorithm
An algorithm is a finite set of instructions or logic, written in order, to accomplish a 
certain predefined task.

### Every Algorithm must satisfy the following properties:

1.Input- There should be 0 or more inputs supplied externally to the algorithm.
2.Output- There should be atleast 1 output obtained.
3.Definiteness- Every step of the algorithm should be clear and well defined.
4.Finiteness- The algorithm should have finite number of steps.
5.Correctness- Every step of the algorithm must generate a correct output.

An algorithm is said to be efficient and fast, if it takes less time to execute and consumes less memory space. Its performance is measured on the basis of following properties :

- Time Complexity
- Space Complexity

## Time Complexity
Time Complexity is a way to represent the amount of time required by the program to run 
till its completion. It's generally a good practice to try to keep the time required minimum,
so that our algorithm completes it's execution in the minimum time possible

## Space Complexity
Its the amount of memory space required by the algorithm, during the course of its execution.
Space complexity must be taken seriously for multi-user systems and in situations where limited 
memory is available.
